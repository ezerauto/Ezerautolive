Here's an expanded prompt for a dual-location business management system:

# **Dual-Location Vehicle Business Platform - Complete System Design**

## **Business Model Overview**

**Two-Location Operation:**

   - Purchase vehicles at auctions/deals
   - Manage US inventory
   - Prepare vehicles for local sale OR shipment to Honduras
   - Create and track shipments to Honduras
   - Coordinate with shippers and brokers

2. **Honduras Import Side** (Roatán)
   - Receive shipped vehicles
   - Manage Honduras inventory
   - Sell vehicles locally
   - Track partnership profits with Tony
   - Process payments

**Integration:** Vehicles flow from US → Honduras, with complete tracking and documentation at each stage.
