# **Vehicle Import Partnership Dashboard - Interface Design Prompt**

## **Project Overview**
Design a clean, professional web-based dashboard to track a vehicle import partnership between Dominick Scipione (Investor) and Tony Hamilton Webster (Dealer Partner). The business imports vehicles from USA to Honduras for resale, with a 60/40 profit distribution during reinvestment phase (until $150K inventory), then 50/50 split.
